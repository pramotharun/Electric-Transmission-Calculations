This is a project submitted for a course on Transmission and Distribution.

Navigation:

1) The various versions of the code has been included in the "subparts of Output" folder

2) The fonts and icon has been included in "others" folder (for exporting as .exe or .app file.

3) Sample output has been shown in the "Sample Output" folder. This includes both the output pdf and the transmission cirles. 


How can this code be used?

The code is used to calculate the following transmission parameters:

Note: This code works only on three phase single circuit transmission system made of bundled conductors in
all the three phases. The sub-conductors of the bundle are stranded ACSR conductors

1. Inductance per phase per km in H/km
2. Capacitance per phase per km in F/km.
3. Inductive reactance of the line in Ohm.
4. Capacitive reactance of the line in Ohm.
5. Charging current drawn from the sending end substation
6. Calculate ABCD parameters of the line.
7. Calculate the sending end voltage in kV, if the receiving end voltage is maintained at
nominal system voltage.
8. Calculate the sending end current in A.
9. Calculate the percentage voltage regulation.
10. Calculate the power loss in the line in MW.
11. Calculate the transmission efficiency.
12. Draw the sending end circle diagram.
13. Draw the receiving end circle diagram.

The above parameters are found using the following input user data:

1. Type of the system - Symmetrical or Unsymmetrical Spacing (transposed)
2. Spacing between the phase conductors
3. Number of sub-conductors per bundle
4. Spacing between the sub-conductors
5. Number of strands in each sub conductor
6. Diameter of each strand
7. Length of the line in km
8. Model of the line (Short/nominal pi/long)
9. Resistance of the line per km
10. Power Frequency
11. Nominal System Voltage
12. Receiving end load in MW.
13. Power factor of receiving end load.
